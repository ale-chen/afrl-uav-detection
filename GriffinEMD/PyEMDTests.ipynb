    "The reason for using this library is that it tends to produce more IMFs from a signal than the other emd library I have been using. This library also seems to have more customization and modifiable parameters, as well as built-in visualization functionality + automatic residual calculation as well\n",
    "\n",
    "The major downside is the difference in computation time, this package seems to take exponentially more time to compute the IMFs for a given signal, I recommend using smaller chunks of signals no longer than 30 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "The results generated using this library will be stored in a directory titled PyEMD_Results, whereas the results generated using the other EMD library will be stored in a directory titled emd_Results. This allows me to keep the results separate and set up various comparisons between the two approaches."
